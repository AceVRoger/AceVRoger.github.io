        <h1>Jacob's Portfolio</h1>

        <p>Hello, my name is Jacob Cardon.
        I am a student at Weber State University right now and have been attending Weber since Fall of 2020.
        I am majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Japanese. Before coming to Weber State University,
        I was living in Japan as a Service Missionary. However, I was forced to return home early due to COVID.
        My goal for now is to graduate from Weber and get some kind of international job connection with Japan. よろしくおねがいします。
        </p>
